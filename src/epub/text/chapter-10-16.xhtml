			<p>In bed, he did not lie like a corpse. At home, he did not put on any formal deportment.</p>
			<p>When he saw any one in a mourning dress, though it might be an acquaintance, he would change countenance; when he saw any one wearing the cap of full dress, or a blind person, though he might be in his undress, he would salute them in a ceremonious manner.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-709" id="noteref-709" epub:type="noteref">709</a></p>

			<p>When he was at an entertainment where there was an abundance of provisions set before him, he would change countenance and rise up.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-711" id="noteref-711" epub:type="noteref">711</a></p>
