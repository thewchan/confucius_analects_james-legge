			<p>When the prince called him to employ him in the reception of a visitor, his countenance appeared to change, and his legs to move forward with difficulty.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-654" id="noteref-654" epub:type="noteref">654</a></p>
			<p>He inclined himself to the <em>other officers</em> among whom he stood, moving his left or right arm, <em>as their position required</em>, but keeping the skirts of his robe before and behind evenly adjusted.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-655" id="noteref-655" epub:type="noteref">655</a></p>
