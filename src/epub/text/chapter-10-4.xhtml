			<p>When he entered the palace gate, he seemed to bend his body, as if it were not sufficient to admit him.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-660" id="noteref-660" epub:type="noteref">660</a></p>
			<p>When he was standing, he did not occupy the middle of the gate-way; when he passed in or out, he did not tread upon the threshold.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-661" id="noteref-661" epub:type="noteref">661</a></p>
			<p>When he was passing the <em>vacant place of the prince</em>, his countenance appeared to change, and his legs to bend under him, and his words came as if he hardly had breath to utter them.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-662" id="noteref-662" epub:type="noteref">662</a></p>
			<p>He ascended the reception hall, holding up his robe with both his hands, and his body bent; holding in his breath also, as if he dared not breathe.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-663" id="noteref-663" epub:type="noteref">663</a></p>
			<p>When he came out <em>from the audience</em>, as soon as he had descended one step, he began to relax his countenance, and had a satisfied look. When he had got to the bottom of the steps, he advanced rapidly to his place, <em>with his arms</em> like wings, and on occupying it, his manner <em>still</em> showed respectful uneasiness.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-665" id="noteref-665" epub:type="noteref">665</a></p>
