			<p>The superior man did not use a deep purple, or a puce colour, in the ornaments of his dress.</p>
			<p>Even in his undress, he did not wear anything of a red or reddish colour.</p>
			<p>In warm weather, he had a single garment either of coarse or fine texture, but he wore it displayed over an inner garment.</p>
			<p>Over lamb's fur he wore a garment of black; over fawn's fur one of white; and over fox's fur one of yellow.</p>
			<p>The fur robe of his undress was long, with the right sleeve short.</p>
			<p>He required his sleeping dress to be half as long again as his body.</p>
			<p>When staying at home, he used thick furs of the fox or the badger.</p>
			<p>When he put off mourning, he wore all the appendages of the girdle.</p>
			<p>His under-garment, except when it was required to be of the curtain shape, was made of silk cut narrow above and wide below.</p>
			<p>He did not wear lamb's fur or a black cap, on a visit of condolence.</p>
			<p>On the first day of the month he put on his court robes, and presented himself at court.</p>
