			<p>Tsze-chang having asked how virtue was to be exalted, and delusions to be discovered, the Master said, "Hold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles, and be moving continually to what is right;â€”this is the way to exalt one's virtue.</p>
			<p>"You love a man and wish him to live; you hate him and wish him to die. Having wished him to live, you also wish him to die. This is a case of delusion.</p>
			<p>"'It may not be on account of her being rich, yet you come to make a difference.'"</p>
