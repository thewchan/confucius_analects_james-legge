			<p><span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tzǔ-chang</span> asked, "What must the officer be, who may be said to be distinguished?"<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-842" id="noteref-842" epub:type="noteref">842</a></p>
			<p>The Master said, "What is it you call being distinguished?"</p>
			<p><span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tzǔ-chang</span> replied, "It is to be heard of through the State, to be heard of throughout his clan."<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-843" id="noteref-843" epub:type="noteref">843</a></p>
			<p>The Master said, "That is notoriety, not distinction.</p>
			<p>"Now the man of distinction is solid and straightforward, and loves righteousness. He examines people's words, and looks at their countenances. He is anxious to humble himself to others. Such a man will be distinguished in the country; he will be distinguished in his clan.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-844" id="noteref-844" epub:type="noteref">844</a></p>
			<p>"As to the man of notoriety, he assumes the appearance of virtue, but his actions are opposed to it, and he rests in this character without any doubts <em>about himself</em>. Such a man will be heard of in the country; he will be heard of in the clan."<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-845" id="noteref-845" epub:type="noteref">845</a></p>
