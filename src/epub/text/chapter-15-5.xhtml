			<p><span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tzǔ-chang</span> asked how a man should conduct himself, so as to be everywhere appreciated.</p>
			<p>The Master said, "Let his words be sincere and truthful, and his actions honourable and careful;—such conduct may be practised among the rude tribes of the South or the North. If his words be not sincere and truthful and his actions not honourable and careful, will he, with such conduct, be appreciated, even in his neighborhood?</p>
			<p>"When he is standing, let him see those two things, as it were, fronting him. When he is in a carriage, let him see them attached to the yoke. Then may he subsequently carry them into practice."</p>
			<p><span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tzǔ-chang</span> wrote these counsels on the end of his sash.</p>
