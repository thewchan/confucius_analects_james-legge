			<p>The Master said, "Truly straightforward was the historiographer <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Yü</span>. When good government prevailed in his State, he was like an arrow. When bad government prevailed, he was like an arrow.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1066" id="noteref-1066" epub:type="noteref">1066</a></p>
			<p>A superior man indeed is <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chʽü Po-yü</span>! When good government prevails in his state, he is to be found in office. When bad government prevails, he can roll his principles up, and keep them in his breast."<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1067" id="noteref-1067" epub:type="noteref">1067</a></p>
