			<p><span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chʽên Kʽang</span> asked <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Po-yü</span>, saying, "Have you heard any lessons <em>from your father</em> different <em>from what we have all heard?</em>"<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1183" id="noteref-1183" epub:type="noteref">1183</a></p>
			<p><span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Po-yü</span> replied, "No. He was standing alone once, when I passed below the hall with hasty steps, and said to me, 'Have you learned the odes?' On my replying 'Not yet,' <em>he added</em>, 'If you do not learn the odes, you will not be fit to converse with.' I retired and studied the odes.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1184" id="noteref-1184" epub:type="noteref">1184</a></p>
			<p>"Another day, he was in the same way standing alone, when I passed by below the hall with hasty steps, and said to me, "Have you learned the rules of propriety?" On my replying "Not yet," <em>he added</em>, "If you do not learn the rules of propriety, your character cannot be established." I then retired, and learned the rules of propriety.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1185" id="noteref-1185" epub:type="noteref">1185</a></p>
			<p>"I have heard only these two things from him."<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1186" id="noteref-1186" epub:type="noteref">1186</a></p>
			<p><span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chʽên Kʽang</span> retired, and, quite delighted, said, "I asked one thing, and I have got three things. I have heard about the odes. I have heard about the rules of propriety. I have also heard that the superior man maintains a distant reserve towards his son."<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1187" id="noteref-1187" epub:type="noteref">1187</a></p>
