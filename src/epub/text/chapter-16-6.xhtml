			<p>Confucius said, "There are three errors to which they who stand in the presence of a man of virtue and station are liable. They may speak when it does not come to them to speak;—this is called rashness. They may not speak when it comes to them to speak;—this is called concealment. They may speak without looking at the countenance <em>of their superior</em>;—this is called blindness."<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1168" id="noteref-1168" epub:type="noteref">1168</a></p>
