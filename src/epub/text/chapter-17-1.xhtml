			<p><span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Yang Huo</span> wished to see Confucius, but Confucius would not go to see him. <em>On this</em>, he sent a present of a pig to Confucius, who, having chosen a time when Ho was not at home, went to pay his respects <em>for the gift</em>. He met him, however, on the way.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1192" id="noteref-1192" epub:type="noteref">1192</a></p>
			<p><em><span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Huo</span></em> said to Confucius, "Come, let me speak with you." He then asked, "Can he be called benevolent who keeps his jewel in his bosom, and leaves his country to confusion?" <em>Confucius</em> replied, "No." "Can he be called wise, who is anxious to be engaged in public employment, and yet is constantly losing the opportunity of being so?" <em>Confucius again</em> said, "No." "The days and months are passing away; the years do not wait for us." Confucius said, "Right; I will go into office."<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1193" id="noteref-1193" epub:type="noteref">1193</a></p>
