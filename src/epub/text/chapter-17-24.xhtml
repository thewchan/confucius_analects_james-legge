He hates the man who, being in a low station, slanders his superiors. He hates those who have valour <em>merely</em>, and are unobservant of propriety. He hates those who are forward and determined, and, <em>at the same time</em>, of contracted understanding."<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1259" id="noteref-1259" epub:type="noteref">1259</a></p>

I hate those who are <em>only</em> not modest, and think that they are valorous. I hate those who make known secrets, and think that they are straightforward."<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1260" id="noteref-1260" epub:type="noteref">1260</a></p>
