			<p><span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chʽang-tsu</span> and <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chieh-ni</span> were at work in the field together, when Confucius passed by them, and sent <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tzǔ-lu</span> to inquire for the ford.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1277" id="noteref-1277" epub:type="noteref">1277</a></p>
			<p><span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chʽang-tsu</span> said, "Who is he that holds the reins in the carriage there?" <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tzǔ-lu</span> told him, "It is <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Kʽung Chʽiu</span>." "Is it not <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Kʽung Chʽiu</span> of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lu</span>?" asked he. "Yes," was the reply, to which the other rejoined, "He knows the ford."<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1278" id="noteref-1278" epub:type="noteref">1278</a></p>
			<p><em><span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tzǔ-lu</span> then</em> inquired of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chieh-ni</span>, who said to him, "Who are you, sir?" He answered, "I am <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chung Yu</span>." "Are you not the disciple of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Kʽung Chʽiu</span> of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lu</span>?" asked the other. "I am," replied he, and then <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chieh-ni</span> said to him, "Disorder, like a swelling flood, spreads over the whole empire, and who is he that will change its state <em>for you</em>? Than follow one who merely withdraws from this one and that one, had you not better follow those who have withdrawn from the world altogether?" <em>With this</em> he fell to covering up the seed, and proceeded with his work, without stopping.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1279" id="noteref-1279" epub:type="noteref">1279</p>
			<p><span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tzǔ-lu</span> went and reported their remarks, when the Master observed with a sigh, "It is impossible to associate with birds and beasts, as if they were the same with us. If I associate not with these people,—with mankind,—with whom shall I associate? If right principles prevailed through the empire, there would be no use for me to change its state."<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1280" id="noteref-1280" epub:type="noteref">1280</a></p>
