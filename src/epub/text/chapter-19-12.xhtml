			<p><span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tzǔ-yu</span> said, "The disciples and followers of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tzǔ-hsia</span>, in sprinkling and sweeping the ground, in answering and replying, in advancing and receding, are sufficiently accomplished. But these are only the branches <em>of learning</em>, and they are left ignorant of what is essential.—How can they be acknowledged as sufficiently taught?"<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1323" id="noteref-1323" epub:type="noteref">1323</a></p>
			<p><span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tzǔ-hsia</span> heard of the remark and said, "Alas! <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Yen Yu</span> is wrong. According to the way of the superior man <em>in teaching</em>, what departments are there which he considers of prime importance, and delivers? what are there which he considers of secondary importance, and allows himself to be idle about? <em>But</em> as in the case of plants, which are assorted according to their classes, <em>so he deals with his disciples</em>. How can the way of a superior man be such as to make fools of <em>any</em> of them? Is it not the sage alone, who can unite in one the beginning and the consummation <em>of learning</em>?"<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1324" id="noteref-1324" epub:type="noteref">1324</a></p>
