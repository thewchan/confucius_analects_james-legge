			<p>The disciples of Tsze-hsia asked <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tzǔ-chang</span> about the principles that should characterize mutual intercourse. <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tzǔ-chang</span> asked, "What does Tsze-hsia say on the subject?" They replied, "Tsze-hsia says:—'Associate with those who can advantage you. Put away from you those who cannot do so.'" <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tzǔ-chang</span> observed, "This is different from what I have learned. The superior man honours the talented and virtuous, and bears with all. He praises the good, and pities the incompetent. Am I possessed of great talents and virtue?—who is there among men whom I will not bear with? Am I devoid of talents and virtue?—men will put me away from them. What have we to do with the putting away of others?"</p>
