			<p><span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tzǔ-chang</span> asked Confucius, saying, "In what way should <em>a person in authority</em> act in order that he may conduct government properly?" The Master replied, "Let him honour the five excellent, and banish away the four bad, things;—then may he conduct government properly." <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tzǔ-chang</span> said, "What are meant by the five excellent things?" The Master said, "When the person in authority is beneficent without great expenditure; when he lays tasks <em>on the people</em> without their repining; when he <em>pursues what he</em> desires without being covetous; when he maintains a dignified ease without being proud; when he is majestic without being fierce."<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1362" id="noteref-1362" epub:type="noteref">1362</a></p>
			<p><span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tzǔ-chang</span> said, "What is meant by being beneficent without great expenditure?" The Master replied, "When <em>the person in authority</em> makes more beneficial to the people the things from which they naturally derive benefit;—is not this being beneficent without <em>great</em> expenditure? When he chooses the labours which are proper, and makes them labour on them, who will repine? When his desires are set on benevolent <em>government</em>, and he secures it, who will accuse him of covetousness? Whether he has to do with many people or few, or with things great or small, he does not dare to indicate any disrespect;—is not this to maintain a dignified ease without any pride? He adjusts his clothes and cap, and throws a dignity into his looks, so that, thus dignified, he is looked at with awe;—is not this to be majestic without being fierce?"<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1363" id="noteref-1363" epub:type="noteref">1363</a></p>
			<p><span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tzǔ-chang</span> then asked, "What are meant by the four bad things?" The Master said, "To put the people to death without having instructed them;—this is called cruelty. To require from them, <em>suddenly</em>, the full tale of work, without having given them warning;—this is called oppression. To issue orders as if without urgency, <em>at first</em>, and, when the time comes, <em>to insist on them with severity</em>;—this is called injury. And, generally, in the giving <em>pay or rewards</em> to men, to do it in a stingy way;—this is called acting the part of a mere official."<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1364" id="noteref-1364" epub:type="noteref">1364</a></p>
