			<p>The minister of crime of Ch'an asked whether the duke Chao knew propriety, and Confucius said, "He knew propriety."</p>
			<p>Confucius having retired, the minister bowed to Wu-ma Ch'i to come forward, and said, "I have heard that the superior man is not a partisan. May the superior man be a partisan also? The prince married a daughter of the house of Wu, of the same surname with himself, and called her,â€”'The elder Tsze of Wu.' If the prince knew propriety, who does not know it?"</p>
			<p>Wu-ma Ch'i reported these remarks, and the Master said, "I am fortunate! If I have any errors, people are sure to know them."</p>
