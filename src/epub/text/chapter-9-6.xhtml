			<p>A high officer asked <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tzǔ-kung</span>, saying, "May we not say that your Master is a sage? How various is his ability!"<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-591" id="noteref-591" epub:type="noteref">591</a></p>
			<p><span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tzǔ-kung</span> said, "Certainly Heaven has endowed him unlimitedly. He is about a sage. And, moreover, his ability is various."<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-592" id="noteref-592" epub:type="noteref">592</a></p>
			<p>The Master heard of the conversation and said, "Does the high officer know me? When I was young, my condition was low, and therefore I acquired my ability in many things, but they were mean matters. Must the superior man have such variety of ability? He does not need variety of ability."<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-593" id="noteref-593" epub:type="noteref">593</a></p>
			<p><span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao</span> said, "The Master said, 'Having no official employment, I acquired many arts.'"<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-594" id="noteref-594" epub:type="noteref">594</a></p>
