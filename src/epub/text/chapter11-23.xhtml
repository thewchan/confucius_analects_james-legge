			<p>Chi Tsze-zan asked whether Chung Yu and Zan Ch'iu could be called great ministers.</p>
			<p>The Master said, "I thought you would ask about some extraordinary individuals, and you only ask about Yu and Ch'iu!</p>
			<p>"What is called a great minister, is one who serves his prince according to what is right, and when he finds he cannot do so, retires.
			<p>"Now, as to Yu and Ch'iu, they may be called ordinary ministers."</p>
			<p>Tsze-zan said, "Then they will always follow their chief;â€”will they?"</p>
			<p>The Master said, "In an act of parricide or regicide, they would not follow him."</p>
