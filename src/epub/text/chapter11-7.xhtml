			<p>When Yen Yuan died, Yen Lu begged the carriage of the Master to sell and get an outer shell for his son's coffin.</p>
			<p>The Master said, "Every one calls his son his son, whether he has talents or has not talents. There was Li; when he died, he had a coffin but no outer shell. I would not walk on foot to get a shell for him, because, having followed in the rear of the great officers, it was not proper that I should walk on foot."</p>
