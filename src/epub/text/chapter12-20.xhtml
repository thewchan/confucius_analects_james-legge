			<p>Tsze-chang asked, "What must the officer be, who may be said to be distinguished?"</p>
			<p>The Master said, "What is it you call being distinguished?"</p>
			<p>Tsze-chang replied, "It is to be heard of through the State, to be heard of throughout his clan."</p>
			<p>The Master said, "That is notoriety, not distinction.</p>
			<p>"Now the man of distinction is solid and straightforward, and loves righteousness. He examines people's words, and looks at their countenances. He is anxious to humble himself to others. Such a man will be distinguished in the country; he will be distinguished in his clan.</p>
			<p>"As to the man of notoriety, he assumes the appearance of virtue, but his actions are opposed to it, and he rests in this character without any doubts about himself. Such a man will be heard of in the country; he will be heard of in the clan."</p>
