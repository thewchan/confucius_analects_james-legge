			<p>The Duke Ai inquired of Yu Zo, saying, "The year is one of scarcity, and the returns for expenditure are not sufficient;—what is to be done?"</p>
			<p>Yu Zo replied to him, "Why not simply tithe the people?"</p>
			<p>"With two tenths, said the duke, "I find it not enough;—how could I do with that system of one tenth?"</p>
			<p>Yu Zo answered, "If the people have plenty, their prince will not be left to want alone. If the people are in want, their prince cannot enjoy plenty alone."</p>
