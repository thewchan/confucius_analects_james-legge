			<p>The Master, having come to Wu-ch'ang, heard there the sound of stringed instruments and singing.</p>
			<p>Well pleased and smiling, he said, "Why use an ox knife to kill a fowl?"</p>
			<p>Tsze-yu replied, "Formerly, Master, I heard you say,â€”'When the man of high station is well instructed, he loves men; when the man of low station is well instructed, he is easily ruled.'"</p>
			<p>The Master said, "My disciples, Yen's words are right. What I said was only in sport."</p>
