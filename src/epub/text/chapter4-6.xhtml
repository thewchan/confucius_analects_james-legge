			<p>The Master said, "I have not seen a person who loved virtue, or one who hated what was not virtuous. He who loved virtue, would esteem nothing above it. He who hated what is not virtuous, would practise virtue in such a way that he would not allow anything that is not virtuous to approach his person.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-261" id="noteref-261" epub:type="noteref">261</a></p>
