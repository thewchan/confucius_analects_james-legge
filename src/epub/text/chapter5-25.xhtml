			<p>Yen Yuan and Chi Lu being by his side, the Master said to them, "Come, let each of you tell his wishes."</p>
			<p>Tsze-lu said, "I should like, having chariots and horses, and light fur dresses, to share them with my friends, and though they should spoil them, I would not be displeased."</p>
			<p>Yen Yuan said, "I should like not to boast of my excellence, nor to make a display of my meritorious deeds."</p>
			<p>Tsze-lu then said, "I should like, sir, to hear your wishes." The Master said, "They are, in regard to the aged, to give them rest; in regard to friends, to show them sincerity; in regard to the young, to treat them tenderly."</p>
