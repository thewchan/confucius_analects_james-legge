<p>Mang Wu asked about Tsze-lu, whether he was perfectly virtuous. The Master said, "I do not know."</p>
			<p>He asked again, when the Master replied, "In a kingdom of a thousand chariots, Yu might be employed to manage the military levies, but I do not know whether he be perfectly virtuous."</p>
			<p>"And what do you say of Ch'iu?" The Master replied, "In a city of a thousand families, or a clan of a hundred chariots, Ch'iu might be employed as governor, but I do not know whether he is perfectly virtuous."</p>
			<p>"What do you say of Ch'ih?" The Master replied, "With his sash girt and standing in a court, Ch'ih might be employed to converse with the visitors and guests, but I do not know whether he is perfectly virtuous."</p>
			<p>The Master said to Tsze-kung, "Which do you consider superior, yourself or Hui?"</p>
			<p>Tsze-kung replied, "How dare I compare myself with Hui? Hui hears one point and knows all about a subject; I hear one point, and know a second."</p>
			<p>The Master said, "You are not equal to him. I grant you, you are not equal to him."</p>
