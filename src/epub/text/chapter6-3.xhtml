			<p>Tsze-hwa being employed on a mission to Ch'i, the disciple Zan requested grain for his mother. The Master said, "Give her a fu." Yen requested more. "Give her an yu," said the Master. Yen gave her five ping.</p>
			<p>The Master said, "When Ch'ih was proceeding to Ch'i, he had fat horses to his carriage, and wore light furs. I have heard that a superior man helps the distressed, but does not add to the wealth of the rich."</p>
			<p>Yuan Sze being made governor of his town by the Master, he gave him nine hundred measures of grain, but Sze declined them.</p>
			<p>The Master said, "Do not decline them. May you not give them away in the neighborhoods, hamlets, towns, and villages?"</p>
