			<p>The Master said to Yen Yuan, "When called to office, to undertake its duties; when not so called, to lie retired;â€”it is only I and you who have attained to this."</p>
			<p>Tsze-lu said, "If you had the conduct of the armies of a great State, whom would you have to act with you?"</p>
			<p>The Master said, "I would not have him to act with me, who will unarmed attack a tiger, or cross a river without a boat, dying without any regret. My associate must be the man who proceeds to action full of solicitude, who is fond of adjusting his plans, and then carries them into execution."<?
