			<p>The Master said, "With sincere faith he unites the love of learning; holding firm to death, he is perfecting the excellence of his course.</p>
			<p>"Such an one will not enter a tottering State, nor dwell in a disorganized one. When right principles of government prevail in the kingdom, he will show himself; when they are prostrated, he will keep concealed.</p>
			<p>"When a country is well-governed, poverty and a mean condition are things to be ashamed of. When a country is ill-governed, riches and honour are things to be ashamed of."</p>
