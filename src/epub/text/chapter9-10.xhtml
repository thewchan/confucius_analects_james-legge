			<p>Yen Yuan, in admiration of the Master's doctrines, sighed and said, "I looked up to them, and they seemed to become more high; I tried to penetrate them, and they seemed to become more firm; I looked at them before me, and suddenly they seemed to be behind.</p>
			<p>"The Master, by orderly method, skilfully leads men on. He enlarged my mind with learning, and taught me the restraints of propriety.</p>
			<p>"When I wish to give over the study of his doctrines, I cannot do so, and having exerted all my ability, there seems something to stand right up before me; but though I wish to follow and lay hold of it, I really find no way to do so."</p>
