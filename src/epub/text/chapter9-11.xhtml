			<p>The Master being very ill, Tsze-lu wished the disciples to act as ministers to him.</p>
			<p>During a remission of his illness, he said, "Long has the conduct of Yu been deceitful! By pretending to have ministers when I have them not, whom should I impose upon? Should I impose upon Heaven?</p>
			<p>"Moreover, than that I should die in the hands of ministers, is it not better that I should die in the hands of you, my disciples? And though I may not get a great burial, shall I die upon the road?"</p>
