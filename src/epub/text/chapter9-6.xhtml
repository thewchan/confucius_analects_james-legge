			<p>A high officer asked Tsze-kung, saying, "May we not say that your Master is a sage? How various is his ability!"</p>
			<p>Tsze-kung said, "Certainly Heaven has endowed him unlimitedly. He is about a sage. And, moreover, his ability is various."</p>
			<p>The Master heard of the conversation and said, "Does the high officer know me? When I was young, my condition was low, and therefore I acquired my ability in many things, but they were mean matters. Must the superior man have such variety of ability? He does not need variety of ability."</p>
			<p>Lao said, "The Master said, 'Having no official employment, I acquired many arts.'"</p>
