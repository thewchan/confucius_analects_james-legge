					<p><strong>Title of the work.</strong>&mdash;<span xml:lang="zh" epub:type="se:name.publication.book">論語</span>, "Discourses and Dialogues;" that is, the discourses or discussions of Confucius with his disciples and others on various topics, and his replies to their inquiries. Many chapters, however, and one whole book, are the sayings, not of the sage himself, but of some of his disciples. The characters may also be rendered "Digested Conversations," and this appears to be the more ancient signification attached to them, the account being that, after the death of Confucius, his disciples collected together and compared the memoranda of his conversations which they had severally preserved, digesting them into the twenty books which composed the work. Hence the title&mdash;<span xml:lang="zh" epub:type="se:name.publication.book">論語</span>, "Discussed Sayings," or "Digested Conversations." See <span xmn:lang="zh" epub:type="se:name.publication.book">論語註疏解經序</span>. I have styled the work <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Confucian Analects</i>, as being more descriptive of its character than any other name I could think of.<a href="halftitle.xhtml#noteref-1" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				<li id="note-2" epub:type="endnote">
					<p><strong>Heading of this book.</strong>&mdash;<span xml:lang="zh">學而第一</span>. The two first characters in the book, after the introductory&mdash;"The Master said," are adopted as its heading. The is similar to the custom of the Jews, who name many books in the Bible from the first word in them. <span xml:lang="zh">第一</span>, "The First;" that is, of the twenty books composing the whole work. In some of the books we find a unity or analogy of subjects, which evidently guided the compilers in grouping the chapters together. Others seem devoid of any such principle of combination. The sixteen chapters of this book are occupied, it is said, with the fundamental subjects which ought to engage the attention of the learner, and the great matters of human practice. The word <span xml:lang="zh">學</span>, "<emph>learn</emph>," rightly occupies the forefront in the studies of a nation, of which its educational system has so long been the distinction and glory.<a href="chapter1-1.xhtml#noteref-2" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p><strong>The whole work and achievement of the learning, first perfecting his knowledge, then attracting by his fame like-minded individuals, and finally complete in himself.</strong><a href="chapter1-1.xhtml#noteref-3" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				<li id="note-4" epub:type="endnote">
					<p><span xml:lang="zh">子</span>, at the commencement, indicates Confucius. <span xml:lang="zh">子</span>, "a son," is also the common designation of males,&mdash;especially of virtuous men. We find it, in conversations, used in the same way as our "Sir." When it <emph>follows</emph> the surname, it is equivalent to our "<abbr>Mr.</abbr>" or may be rendered "the philosopher," "the scholar," "the officer," <abbr>etc.</abbr> Often, however, it is better to leave it untranslated. When it <emph>precedes</emph> the surname, it indicates the person spoken of was the master of the writer, as <span xml:lang="zh">子沈子</span>, "my master, the philosopher <span xml:lang="zh">沈</span>." Standing single and alone, as in the text, it denotes Confucius, <emph>the philosopher</emph>, or, rather, <emph>the master</emph>. If we render the term by Confucius, as all preceding translators have done, we miss the indication which it gives of the handiwork of his disciples, and the reverence which it bespeaks for him.<a href="chapter1-1.xhtml#noteref-4" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-5" epub:type="endnote">
					<p><span xml:lang="zh">不亦...乎</span> is explained by <span xml:lang="zh">豈不</span>, "is it not?" See <span xml:lang="zh" epub:type="se:name.publication.book">四書補注備旨</span>. To bring out the force of "also" in <span xml:lang="zh">亦</span>, some say thus:&mdash;"The occasions for pleasure are many, <emph>is this also one?</emph>" But it is better to consider <span xml:lang="zh">亦</span> as merely redundant;&mdash;see Wang Yin-chih's masterly Treatise on the particles, chap. iii; it forms chaps 1208 to 1217 of the <span xml:lang="zh" epub:type="se:name.publication.book">皇清經解說</span>, read <i xml:lang="zh">yue</i>, as always when it has the entering tone marked, stands for <span xml:lang="zh">悅</span>. What is learned becomes by practice and application one's own, and hence arises complacent pleasure in the mastering mind. <span xml:lang="zh">悅</span>, as distinguished from <span xml:lang="zh">樂</span> (<i xml:lang="zh">loh</i>), in the next paragraph, is the internal, individual feeling of pleasure, and the other, its external manifestation, implying also companionship.<a href="chapter1-1.xhtml#noteref-5" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				<li id="note-6" epub:type="endnote">
					<p><span xml:lang="zh">學</span>, in the old commentators, is explained by <span xml:lang="zh">誦</span>, "to read chantingly," "to discuss." Chu Hsi interprets it by <span xml:lang="zh">效</span>, "to imitate," and makes its results to be <span xml:lang="zh">明善而復初</span>, "the understanding of all excellence, and the bringing back original goodness." Subsequent scholars profess, for the most part, great admiration of this explanation. It is an illustration, to my mind, of the way in which Chu Hsi and his followers are continually being wise above what is written in the classical books. <span xml:lang="zh">習</span> is the rapid and frequent motion of the wings of a bird in flying, used for "to repeat," "to practise." <span xml:lang="zh">之</span> is the object of the third person pronoun, and its antecedent is to be found in the pregnant meaning of <span xml:lang="zh">學</span>.<a href="chapter1-1.xhtml#noteref-6" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p><span xml:lang="zh">君子</span> I translate here&mdash;"a man of complete virtue." Literally, it is&mdash;"a princely man." See on <span xml:lang="zh">子</span>, above. It is a technical term in Chinese moral writers, for which there is no exact correspondency in English, and which cannot be rendered always in the same way. See Morrison's Dictionary, character <span xml:lang="zh">子</span>. Its opposite is <span xml:lang="zh">小人</span>, "a small, mean man."<a href="chapter1-1.xhtml#noteref-8" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p><span xml:lang="zh">人不知</span>, "Men do not know him," but anciently some explained&mdash;"men do not know," that is, are stupid under his teaching. The interpretation in the text is, doubtless, the correct one.<a href="chapter1-1.xhtml#noteref-9" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Yu, named <span xml:lang="zh">若</span>, and styled <span xml:lang="zh">子有</span>, and <span xml:lang="zh">子若</span>, a native of <span xml:lang="zh">魯</span>, was famed among the other disciples of Confucius for his strong memory, and love for the doctrines of antiquity. In something about him he resembled the sage. See <cite><i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Mencius</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span>. <abbr>Pt</abbr>. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I. iv.</span> 13.</cite> <span xml:lang="zh">有子</span> is "Yu, the philosopher," and he and Tsang Shan are the only two of Confucius's disciples who are mentioned in this style in the "<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Lun Yu</i>. This has led to an opinion on the part of some, that the work was compiled by the disciples. This may not be sufficiently supported, but I have not found the peculiarity pointed out satisfactorily explained. The tablet of Yu's spirit is now in the same apartment of the sage's temples as that of the same himself, occupying the 6th place in the eastern range of "the wise ones." To this position it was promoted in the 3rd year of Ch'ien-lung of the present dynasty.<a href="chapter1-2.xhtml#noteref-11" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Tsang, whose name was <span xml:lang="zh">參(Shan)</span>, and his designation <span xml:lang="zh">子舆</span>, was one of the principal disciples of Confucius. A follower of the sage from his 16th year, though inferior in natural ability to some others, by his filial piety and other moral qualities, he entirely won the Master's esteem, and by persevering attention mastered his doctrines. Confucius, it is said, employed him in the composition of the <span xml:lang="zh" epub:type="se:name.publication.book">考經</span>, or <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Classics of Filial Piety</i>. The authorship of the <span xml:lang="zh" epub:type="se:name.publication.book">大學</span>, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">The Great Learning</i>, is also ascribed to him, though incorrectly, as we shall see.
