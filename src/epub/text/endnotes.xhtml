					<p><strong>Title of the work.</strong>&mdash;<span xml:land="zh">論語</span>, "Discourses and Dialogues;" that is, the discourses or discussions of Confucius with his disciples and others on various topics, and his replies to their inquiries. Many chapters, however, and one whole book, are the sayings, not of the sage himself, but of some of his disciples. The characters may also be rendered "Digested Conversations," and this appears to be the more ancient signification attached to them, the account being that, after the death of Confucius, his disciples collected together and compared the memoranda of his conversations which they had severally preserved, digesting them into the twenty books which composed the work. Hence the title&mdash;<span xml:lang="zh">論語</span>, "Discussed Sayings," or "Digested Conversations." See <span xmn:lang="zh">論語註疏解經序</span>. I have styled the work "Confucian Analects," as being more descriptive of its character than any other name I could think of.<a href="halftitle.xhtml#noteref-1" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
