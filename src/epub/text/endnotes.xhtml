					<p><strong>Title of the work.</strong>&mdash;<span xml:lang="zh" epub:type="se:name.publication.book">論語</span>, "Discourses and Dialogues;" that is, the discourses or discussions of Confucius with his disciples and others on various topics, and his replies to their inquiries. Many chapters, however, and one whole book, are the sayings, not of the sage himself, but of some of his disciples. The characters may also be rendered "Digested Conversations," and this appears to be the more ancient signification attached to them, the account being that, after the death of Confucius, his disciples collected together and compared the memoranda of his conversations which they had severally preserved, digesting them into the twenty books which composed the work. Hence the title&mdash;<span xml:lang="zh" epub:type="se:name.publication.book">論語</span>, "Discussed Sayings," or "Digested Conversations." See <span xmn:lang="zh" epub:type="se:name.publication.book">論語註疏解經序</span>. I have styled the work <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Confucian Analects</i>, as being more descriptive of its character than any other name I could think of.<a href="halftitle.xhtml#noteref-1" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p><strong>Heading of this book.</strong>&mdash;<span xml:lang="zh">學而第一</span>. The two first characters in the book, after the introductory&mdash;"The Master said," are adopted as its heading. The is similar to the custom of the Jews, who name many books in the Bible from the first word in them. <span xml:lang="zh">第一</span>, "The First;" that is, of the twenty books composing the whole work. In some of the books we find a unity or analogy of subjects, which evidently guided the compilers in grouping the chapters together. Others seem devoid of any such principle of combination. The sixteen chapters of this book are occupied, it is said, with the fundamental subjects which ought to engage the attention of the learner, and the great matters of human practice. The word <span xml:lang="zh">學</span>, "<em>learn</em>," rightly occupies the forefront in the studies of a nation, of which its educational system has so long been the distinction and glory.<a href="chapter1-1.xhtml#noteref-2" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p><span xml:lang="zh">子</span>, at the commencement, indicates Confucius. <span xml:lang="zh">子</span>, "a son," is also the common designation of males,&mdash;especially of virtuous men. We find it, in conversations, used in the same way as our "Sir." When it <em>follows</em> the surname, it is equivalent to our "<abbr>Mr.</abbr>" or may be rendered "the philosopher," "the scholar," "the officer," <abbr>etc.</abbr> Often, however, it is better to leave it untranslated. When it <em>precedes</em> the surname, it indicates the person spoken of was the master of the writer, as <span xml:lang="zh">子沈子</span>, "my master, the philosopher <span xml:lang="zh">沈</span>." Standing single and alone, as in the text, it denotes Confucius, <em>the philosopher</em>, or, rather, <em>the master</em>. If we render the term by Confucius, as all preceding translators have done, we miss the indication which it gives of the handiwork of his disciples, and the reverence which it bespeaks for him.<a href="chapter1-1.xhtml#noteref-4" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

To bring out the force of "also" in <span xml:lang="zh">亦</span>, some say thus:&mdash;"The occasions for pleasure are many, <em>is this also one?</em>" But it is better to consider <span xml:lang="zh">亦</span> as merely redundant;&mdash;see Wang Yin-chih's masterly Treatise on the particles, chap. iii; it forms chaps 1208 to 1217 of the <span xml:lang="zh" epub:type="se:name.publication.book">皇清經解說</span>, read <i xml:lang="zh">yue</i>, as always when it has the entering tone marked, stands for <span xml:lang="zh">悅</span>.

					<p><span xml:lang="zh">學</span>, in the old commentators, is explained by <span xml:lang="zh">誦</span>, "to read chantingly," "to discuss." Chu Hsi interprets it by <span xml:lang="zh">效</span>, "to imitate," and makes its results to be <span xml:lang="zh">明善而復初</span>, "the understanding of all excellence, and the bringing back original goodness." Subsequent scholars profess, for the most part, great admiration of this explanation. It is an illustration, to my mind, of the way in which Chu Hsi and his followers are continually being wise above what is written in the classical books. <span xml:lang="zh">習</span> is the rapid and frequent motion of the wings of a bird in flying, used for "to repeat," "to practise." <span xml:lang="zh">之</span> is the object of the third <abbr>pers</abbr> pronoun, and its antecedent is to be found in the pregnant meaning of <span xml:lang="zh">學</span>.<a href="chapter1-1.xhtml#noteref-6" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Yu, named <span xml:lang="zh">若</span>, and styled <span xml:lang="zh">子有</span>, and <span xml:lang="zh">子若</span>, a native of <span xml:lang="zh">魯</span>, was famed among the other disciples of Confucius for his strong memory, and love for the doctrines of antiquity.

This has led to an opinion on the part of some, that the work was compiled by the disciples. This may not be sufficiently supported, but I have not found the peculiarity pointed out satisfactorily explained. The tablet of Yu's spirit is now in the same apartment of the sage's temples as that of the same himself, occupying the 6th place in the eastern range of "the wise ones."
