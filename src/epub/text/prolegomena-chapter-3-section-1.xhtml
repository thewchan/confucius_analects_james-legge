			</hgroup>
			<p>"And have you foreigners surnames as well?" This question has often been put to me by Chinese. It marks the ignorance which belongs to the people of all that is external to themselves, and the pride of antiquity which enters largely as an element into their character. If such a pride could in any case be justified, we might allow it to the family of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Kʽung</span>, the descendants of Confucius. In the reign of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Kʽang-hsi</span>, twenty-one centuries and a half after the death of the sage, they amounted to eleven thousand males. But their ancestry is carried back through a period of equal extent, and genealogical tables are common, in which the descent of Confucius is traced down from <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Huang-ti</span>, in whose resign the cycle was invented, <abbr class="era">BC</abbr> 2627.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1475" id="noteref-1475" epub:type="noteref">1475</a></p>
			<p>The more moderate writers, however, content themselves with exhibiting his ancestry back to the commencement of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chou</span> dynasty, <abbr class="era">BC</abbr> 121. Among the relatives of the tyrant <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chou</span>, the last emperor of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Yin</span> dynasty, was an elder brother, by a concubine, named <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chʽi</span>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1476" id="noteref-1476" epub:type="noteref">1476</a> who is celebrated by Confucius, <cite><abbr>Ana.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XVIII</span> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">i</span></cite>, under the title of the viscount of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Wei</span>. Foreseeing the impending ruin of their family, <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chʽi</span> withdrew from the court; and subsequently he was invested by the emperor <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chʽêng</span>, the second of the house of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chou</span>, with the principality of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Sung</span>, which embraced the eastern portion of the present province of Henan, that he might there continue the sacrifices to the sovereigns of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Yin</span>. <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chʽi</span> was followed as duke of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Sung</span> by a younger brother, in whose line the succession continued. His great-grandson, the the duke <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Min</span>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1477" id="noteref-1477" epub:type="noteref">1477</a> was followed, <abbr class="era">BC</abbr> 908, by a younger brother, leaving, however, two sons, <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Fu-fu Ho</span><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1478" id="noteref-1478" epub:type="noteref">1478</a> and <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Fu-ssǔ</span>.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1479" id="noteref-1479" epub:type="noteref">1479</a> <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Fu Ho</span><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1480" id="noteref-1480" epub:type="noteref">1480</a> resigned his right to the dukedom in favour of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Fang-ssǔ</span>, who put his uncle to death in <abbr class="era">BC</abbr> 893, and became master of the state. He is known as the duke <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Li</span>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1481" id="noteref-1481" epub:type="noteref">1481</a> and to his elder brother belongs the honour of having the sage among his descendants.</p>
			<p>Three descents from <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Fu Ho</span>, we find <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chêng Kʽao-fu</span>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1482" id="noteref-1482" epub:type="noteref">1482</a> who was a distinguished officer under the dukes <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tai</span>, <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Wu</span>, and <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Hsüan</span> (<abbr class="era">BC</abbr> 799–728).<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1483" id="noteref-1483" epub:type="noteref">1483</a> He is still celebrated for his humility, and for his literary tastes. We have accounts of him as being in communication with the grand-historiographer of the kingdom, and engaged in researches about its ancient poetry, thus setting an example of one of the works to which Confucius gave himself.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1484" id="noteref-1484" epub:type="noteref">1484</a> <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Kʽao</span> gave birth to <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Kʽung-fu Chia</span>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1485" id="noteref-1485" epub:type="noteref">1485</a> from whom the surname of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Kʽung</span> took its rise. Five generations had now elapsed since the dukedom was held in the direct line of his ancestry, and it was according to the rule in such cases that the branch should cease its connection with the ducal stem, and merge among the people under a new surname. <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Kʽung Chia</span> was Master of the Horse in <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Sung</span>, and an officer of well-known loyalty and probity. Unfortunately for himself, he had a wife of surpassing beauty, of whom the chief minister of the state, by the name <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Hua Tu</span>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1486" id="noteref-1486" epub:type="noteref">1486</a> happened on one occasion to get a glimpse. Determined to possess her, he commenced a series of intrigues, which ended, <abbr class="era">BC</abbr> 710, in the murder of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chia</span> and of the ruling duke <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Shang</span>.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1487" id="noteref-1487" epub:type="noteref">1487</a> At the same time, <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tu</span> secured the person of the lady, and hastened to his palace with the prize, but on the way she had strangled herself with her girdle.</p>
			<p>An enmity was thus commenced between the two families of <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">Kʽung</span> and <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Hua</span> which the lapse of time did not obliterate, and the latter being the more powerful of the two, <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chia's</span> great-grandson withdrew into the state of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lu</span> to avoid their persecution. There he was appointed commandant of the city of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Fang</span>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1488" id="noteref-1488" epub:type="noteref">1488</a> and is known in history by the name of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Fang-shu</span>.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1489" id="noteref-1489" epub:type="noteref">1489</a> <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Fang-shu</span> gave birth to <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">Po-hsia</span>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1490" id="noteref-1490" epub:type="noteref">1490</a> and from him came <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Shu-liang Ho</span>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1491" id="noteref-1491" epub:type="noteref">1491</a> the father of Confucius. <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ho</span> appears in the history of the times as a soldier of great prowess and daring bravery. In the year of <abbr class="era">BC</abbr> 562, when serving at the siege of a place called <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Fu-yang</span>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1492" id="noteref-1492" epub:type="noteref">1492</a> a party of the assailants made their way in at a gate which had purposely been left open, and no sooner were they inside than the portcullis was dropped. <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ho</span> was just entering; and catching the massive structure with both his hands, he gradually by dint of main strength raised it and held it up, till his friends had made their escape.</p>
			<p>Thus much on the ancestry of the sage. Doubtless he could trace his descent in the way which has been indicated up to the imperial house of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Yin</span>, nor was there one among his ancestors during the rule of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chou</span> to whom he could not refer with satisfaction. They had been ministers and soldiers of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Sung</span> and <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lu</span>, all men of worth and in <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chêng Kʽao</span>, both for his humility and literary researches, Confucius might have special complacency.</p>
			<p>Confucius was the child of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Shu-liang Ho's</span> old age. The soldier had married in early life, but his wife brought him only daughters,—to the number of nine, and no son. By a concubine he had a son, named <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Mêng-pʽi</span>, and also <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Po-ni</span>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1493" id="noteref-1493" epub:type="noteref">1493</a> who proved a cripple, sothat, when he was over seventy years, <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ho</span> sought a second wife in the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Yen</span> family,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1494" id="noteref-1494" epub:type="noteref">1494</a> from which came subsequently <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Yen Hui</span>, the favourite disciple of his son. There were three daughters in the family, the youngest being named <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chêng-tsai</span>.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1495" id="noteref-1495" epub:type="noteref">1495</a> Their father said to them, "Here is the commandant of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tsou</span>. His father and grandfather were only scholars, but his ancestors before them were descendants of the sage sovereigns. He is a man ten feet high,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1496" id="noteref-1496" epub:type="noteref">1496</a> and of extraordinary prowess, and I am very desirous of his alliance. Though he is old and austere, you need have no misgivings about him. Which of you three will be his wife?" The two elder daughters were silent, but <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chêng-tsai</span> said "Why do you ask us, father? It is for you to determine." "Very well," said her father in reply, "you will do." <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chêng-tsai</span>, accordingly, became <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ho's</span> wife, and in due time gave birth to Confucius, who received the name of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chʽiu</span>, and was subsequently styled <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chung-ni</span>.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1497" id="noteref-1497" epub:type="noteref">1497</a> The event happened on the twenty-first day of the tenth month of the twenty-first year of the duke <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Hsiang</span>, of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lu</span>, being the twentieth year of the emperor <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ling</span>, <abbr class="era">BC</abbr> 552.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1498" id="noteref-1498" epub:type="noteref">1498</a> The birth-place was in the district of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tsou</span>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1499" id="noteref-1499" epub:type="noteref">1499</a> of which <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ho</span> was the governor. It was somewhere within the limits of the present department of Yanzhou in Shandong, but the honour of being the exact spot is claimed for two places in two different districts of the department.</p>
			<p>The notices which we have of Confucius's early years are very scanty. When he was in his third year his father died. It is related of him, that as a boy he used to play at the arrangement of sacrificial vessels, and at postures of ceremony. Of his schooling we have no reliable account. There is a legend, indeed, that at seven he went to school to <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Yen Pʽing-chung</span>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1500" id="noteref-1500" epub:type="noteref">1500</a> but it must be rejected as <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Pʽing-chung</span> belonged to the state of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chʽi</span>. He tells us himself that at fifteen he bent his mind to learning;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1501" id="noteref-1501" epub:type="noteref">1501</a> but the condition of the family was one of poverty. At a subsequent period, when people were astonished at the variety of his knowledge, he explained it by saying, "When I was young, my condition was low, and therefore I acquired my ability in many things; but they were mean matters."<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1502" id="noteref-1502" epub:type="noteref">1502</a></p>
			<p>When he was nineteen, he married a lady from the state of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Sung</span>, of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chien-kuan</span> family,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1503" id="noteref-1503" epub:type="noteref">1503</a> and in the following year his son <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Li</span> was born. On the occasion of this event, the duke <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chao</span> sent him a present of a couple of carp. It was to signify his sense of his prince's favour, that he called his son <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Li</span> (<em>the carp</em>), and afterwards gave him the designation of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Po-yü</span><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1504" id="noteref-1504" epub:type="noteref">1504</a> (<em>fish primus</em>). No mention is made of the birth of any other children, though we know, from <cite><abbr>Ana.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">i</span></cite>, that he had at least one daughter. We know also, from an inscription on her grave, that he had one other daughter, who died when he was quite young. The fact of the duke of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lu's</span> sending him a gift on the occasion of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Li's</span> birth, shows that he was not unknown, but was already commanding public attention and the respect of the great.</p>
			<p>It was about this time, probably in the year after his marriage, that Confucius took his first public employment, as keeper of the stores of grain,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1505" id="noteref-1505" epub:type="noteref">1505</a> and in the following year he was put in charge of the public fields and lands.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1506" id="noteref-1506" epub:type="noteref">1506</a> Mencius adduces these employments in illustration of his doctrine that the superior man say at times take office on account of his poverty, but must confine himself in such a case to places of small emolument, and aim at nothing but the discharge of their humble duties. According to him, Confucius, as keeper of stores, said, "My calculations must all be right:—that is all I have to care about;" and when in charge of the public fields, he said, "The oxen and sheep must be fat and strong and superior:—that is all I have to care about."<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1507" id="noteref-1507" epub:type="noteref">1507</a> It does not appear whether these offices were held by Confucius in the direct employment of the state, or as a dependent of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chi</span> family in whose jurisdiction he lived. The present of the carp from the duke may incline us to suppose the former.</p>
			<p>In his twenty-second year, Confucius commenced his labours as a public teacher, and his house became a resort for young and inquiring spirits, who wished to learn the doctrines of antiquity. However small the fee his pupils were able to afford, he never refused his instructions.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1508" id="noteref-1508" epub:type="noteref">1508</a> All that he required, was an ardent desire for improvement, and some degree of capacity. "I do not open up the truth," he said, "to one who is not eager to get knowledge, nor help out anyone who is not anxious to explain himself. When I have presented one corner of a subject to anyone, and he cannot from it learn the other three, I do not repeat my lesson."<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1509" id="noteref-1509" epub:type="noteref">1509</a></p>
			<p>His mother died in the year <abbr class="era">BC</abbr> 527, and he resolved that her body should lie in the same grave with that of his father, and that their common resting-place should be in <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Fang</span>, the first home of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Kʽung</span> in <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lu</span>. But here a difficulty presented itself. His father's coffin had been for twenty years where it had first been deposited, off the road of <em>The Five Fathers</em>, in the vicinity of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tsou</span>:—would it be right in him to move it? He was relieved from this perplexity by an old woman of the neighbourhood, who told him that the coffin had only just been put into the ground, as a temporary arrangement, and not regularly buried. On learning this, he carried his purpose into execution. Both coffins were conveyed to <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Fang</span>, and put in the ground together, with no intervening space between them, as was the custom in some states. And now came a new perplexity. He said to himself, "In old times, they had graves, but raised no tumulus over them. But I am a man, who belongs equally to the north and the south, the east and the west. I must have something by which I can remember the place." Accordingly he raised a mound, four feet high, over the grave, and returned home, leaving party of his disciples to see everything properly completed. In the meantime there came on a heavy storm of rain, and it was a considerable time before the disciples joined him. "What makes you so late?" he asked. "The grave in <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Fang</span> fell down," they said. He made no reply, and they repeated their answer three times, when he burst into tears, and said, "Ah! they did not make their grave so in antiquity."<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1510" id="noteref-1510" epub:type="noteref">1510</a></p>
			<p>Confucius mourned for his mother the regular period of three years,—three years nominally, but in fact only twenty-seven months. Five days after the mourning was expired, he played on his lute, but could not sing. It required other five days before he could accompany an instrument with his voice.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1511" id="noteref-1511" epub:type="noteref">1511</a></p>
			<p>Some writers have represented Confucius as teaching his disciples important lessons from the manner in which he buried his mother, and having a design to correct irregularities in the ordinary funeral ceremonies of the time. These things are altogether "without book." We simply have a dutiful son paying the last tribute of affection to a good parent. In one point he departs from the ancient practice, raising a mound over the grave, and when the fresh earth gives way from a sudden rain, he is moved to tears, and seems to regret his innovation. This sets Confucius vividly before us,—a man of the past as much as of the present, whose own natural feelings were liable to be hampered in their development by the traditions of antiquity which he considered sacred. It is important, however, to observe the reason which he gave for rearing the mound. He had in it a presentiment of much of his future course. He was "a man of the north, the south, the east, and the west." He might not confine himself to any one state. He would travel, and his way might be directed to some "wise ruler," whom his counsels would conduct to a benevolent sway that would break forth on every side till it transformed the empire.</p>
			<p>When the mourning for his mother was over, Confucius remained in <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lu</span>, but in what special capacity we do not know. Probably he continued to encourage the resort of inquirers to whom he communicated instruction, and pursued his own researches into the history, literature, and institutions of the empire. In the year <abbr class="era">BC</abbr> 525, the chief of the small state of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tʽan</span>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1512" id="noteref-1512" epub:type="noteref">1512</a> made his appearance at the court of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lu</span>, and discoursed in a wonderful manner, at a feast given to him by the duke, about the names which the most ancient sovereigns, from <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Huang-ti</span> downwards, gave to their ministers. The sacrifices to the emperor <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Shao-hao</span>, the next in descent from <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Huang-ti</span>, were maintained in <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tʽan</span>, so that the chief fancied that he knew all about the abstruse subject on which he discoursed. Confucius, hearing about the matter, waited on the visitor, and learned from him all that he had to communicate.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1513" id="noteref-1513" epub:type="noteref">1513</a></p>
			<p>To the year <abbr class="era">BC</abbr> 525, when Confucius was twenty-nine years old, is referred his studying music under a famous master of the name of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Hsiang</span>.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1514" id="noteref-1514" epub:type="noteref">1514</a> He was approaching his thirtieth year when, as he tells us, "he stood"<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1515" id="noteref-1515" epub:type="noteref">1515</a> firm, that is, in his convictions on the subjects of learning to which he had bent his mind fifteen years before. Five years more, however, were still to pass by, before the anticipation mentioned in the conclusion of the last paragraph began to receive its fulfilment,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1516" id="noteref-1516" epub:type="noteref">1516</a> though we may conclude from the way in which it was brought about that he was growing all the time in the estimation of the thinking minds in his native state.</p>
			<p>In the twenty-fourth year of duke <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chao</span>, <abbr class="era">BC</abbr> 518, one of the principal ministers of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lu</span>, known by the name of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Mêng Hsi</span>, died. Seventeen years before, he had painfully felt his ignorance of ceremonial observances, and had made it his subsequent business to make himself acquainted with them. On his deathbed, he addressed his chief officer, saying, "A knowledge of propriety is the stem of a man. Without it he has no means of standing firm. I have heard that there is one <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Kʽung Chʽiu</span>, who is thoroughly versed in it. He is descendant of sages, and though the line of his family was extinguished in <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Sung</span>, among his ancestors there were <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Fu-fu Ho</span>, who resigned the state to his brother, and <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chang Kʽao-fu</span>, who was distinguished for his humility. <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tsang Ho</span> has observed that if sage men of intelligent virtue do not attain to eminence, distinguished men are sure to appear among their posterity. His words are now to be verified I think, in <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Kʽung Chʽiu</span>. After my death, you must tell <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ho-chi</span> to go and study proprieties under him."<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1517" id="noteref-1517" epub:type="noteref">1517</a> In consequence of this charge, <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ho-chi</span>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1518" id="noteref-1518" epub:type="noteref">1518</a> <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Mêng Hsi's</span> son, who appears in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Analects</i> under the name of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Mêng Yi</span>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1519" id="noteref-1519" epub:type="noteref">1519</a> and a brother, or perhaps only a near relative, named <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Nan-kung Chêng-shu</span>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1520" id="noteref-1520" epub:type="noteref">1520</a> became disciples of Confucius. Their wealth and standing in the state gave him a position which he had not had before, and he told <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chêng-shu</span> of a wish which he had to visit the court of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chou</span>, and especially to confer on the subject of ceremonies and music with <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao Tan</span>. <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chêng-shu</span> represented the matter to the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chʽao</span>, who put a carriage and a pair of horses at Confucius's disposal for the expedition.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1521" id="noteref-1521" epub:type="noteref">1521</a></p>
			<p>At this time the court of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chou</span> was in the city <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lo</span>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1522" id="noteref-1522" epub:type="noteref">1522</a> in the present department of Henan of the province of the same name. The reigning sovereign is known by the title of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ching</span>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1523" id="noteref-1523" epub:type="noteref">1523</a> but the sovereignty was little more than nominal. The state of China was then analogous to that one of the European kingdoms during the prevalence of the feudal system. At the commencement of the dynasty, the various states of the kingdom had been assigned to the relatives and adherents of the reigning family. There were thirteen principalities of greater note, and a large number of smaller dependencies. During the vigorous youth of the dynasty, the sovereign lord paramount exercised an effective control over the various chiefs, but with the lapse of time there came weakness and decay. The chiefs—corresponding somewhat to European dukes, earls, marquises, barons, <abbr>etc.</abbr>—quarrelled and warred among themselves, and the stronger among them barely acknowledged their subjection to the sovereign. A similar condition of things prevailed in each particular state. There there were hereditary ministerial families, who were continually encroaching on the authority of their rulers, and the heads of those families again were frequently hard pressed by their inferior officers. Such was the state of China in Confusius's time. The read must have it clearly before him, if he would understand the position of the sage, and the reforms which, we shall find, it was subsequently his object to introduce.</p>
			<p>Arrived at <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chou</span>, he had no intercourse with the court or any of the principal ministers. He was there not as a politicians, but as an inquirer about the ceremonies and maxims of the founders of the existing dynasty. <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao Tan</span>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1524" id="noteref-1524" epub:type="noteref">1524</a> whom he had wished to see, generally acknowledged as the founder of the Taoists, or rationalistic sect (so called), which has maintained its ground in opposition to the followers of Confucius, was then a curator of the royal library. They met and freely interchanged their views, but no reliable account of their conversations has been preserved. In the fifth book of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Li Chi</i>, which is headed "The philosopher <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tsêng</span> asked," Confucius refers four times to the views of Laozi on certain points of funeral ceremonies, and in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Narratives of the School</i>, book <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XXIV</span>, he tells <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chi Kʽang</span> what he had heard from him about, "The Five <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ti</span>s," but we may hope their conversation turned also on more important subjects. <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ssǔ-ma Chʽien</span>, favourable to Laozi, makes hi lecture his visitor in the following style:—"Those whom you talk about are dead, and their bones are mouldered to dust; only their words remain. When the superior man gets his time, he mounts aloft; but when the time is against him, he moves as if his feet were entangled. I have heard that a good merchant, though he has rich treasures deeply stored, appears as if he were poor, and that the superior man whose virtue is complete, is yet to outward seeming stupid. Put away your proud air and many desires, your insinuating habit and wild will.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1525" id="noteref-1525" epub:type="noteref">1525</a> These are of no advantage to you. This is all which I have to tell you." On the other hand, Confucius is made to say to his disciples, "I know how birds can fly, how fishes can swim, and how animals can run. But the runner may be snarled, the swimmer may be hooked, and the flyer may be shot by the arrow. But there is the dragon. I cannot tell how he mounts on the wind through the clouds, and rises to heaven. Today I have seen Laozi, and can only compare him to the dragon."<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1526" id="noteref-1526" epub:type="noteref">1526</a></p>
			<p>While at <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lo</span>, Confucius walked over the grounds set apart for the great sacrifices to heaven and earth; inspected the pattern of the Hall of Light, built to give audience in to the princes of the kingdom; and examined all the arrangements of the ancestral temple and the court. From the whole he received a profound impression. "Now," said he with a sigh, "I know the sage wisdom of the duke of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chou</span>, and how the house of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chou</span> attained to the royal sway."<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1527" id="noteref-1527" epub:type="noteref">1527</a> On the walls of the Hall of Light were paintings of the ancient sovereigns from <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Yao</span> and <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Shun</span> downwards, their characters appearing in the representations of them, and words of praise or warning being appended. There was also a picture of the duke of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chou</span> sitting with his infant nephew, the king <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ching</span>, upon his knees, to give audience to all the princes. Confucius surveyed the scene with silent delight, and then said to his followers, "Here you see how <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chou</span> became so great. As we use a glass to examine the forms of things, so must we study antiquity in order to understand the present time."<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1528" id="noteref-1528" epub:type="noteref">1528</a> In the hall of the ancestral temple, there was a metal statue of a man with three clasps upon his mouth, and his back covered over with an enjoyable homily on the duty of keeping a watch upon the lips. Confucius turned to his disciples and said, "Observe it, my children. These words are true, and commend themselves to our feelings."<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1529" id="noteref-1529" epub:type="noteref">1529</a></p>
			<p>About music he made inquiries at <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chêng Hung</span>, to whom the following remarks are attributed:—"I have observed about <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chung-ni</span> many marks of a sage. He has river eyes and a dragon forehead,—the very characteristics of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Huang-ti</span>. His arms are long, his back is like a tortoise, and he is nine feet six inches in height,—the very semblance of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tʽang</span> the Completer. When he speaks, he praises the ancient kings. He moves along the path of humility and courtesy. He has heard of every subject, and retains with a strong memory. His knowledge of things seems inexhaustible.—Have we not in him the rising of a sage?"<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1530" id="noteref-1530" epub:type="noteref">1530</a></p>
			<p>I have given these notices of Confucius at the court of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chou</span>, more as being the only ones I could find, than because I put much faith in them. He did not remain there long, but returned the same year to <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lu</span>, and continued his work of teaching. His fame was greatly increased; disciples. Came to him from different parts, till their number amounted to three thousand. Several of those who have come down to us as the most distinguished among his followers, however, were yet unborn, and the statement just given may be considered as an exaggeration. We are not to conceive of the disciples as forming a community, and living together. Parties of them may have done so. We shall find Confucius hereafter always moving amid a company of admiring pupils; but the greater number must have had their proper avocations and ways of living, and would only resort to the master, when they wished specially to ask his counsel or to learn of him.</p>
